State/Components/Re-rendering -- An object that represents the current state of the app It represents the dynamic things in your app (things that change). For example, the value of the counter

A state change triggers a re-render. A re-render represents the actual DOM being manipulated when the state changes

You usually have to define all your components once
And then all you have to do is update the state of your app, React takes care of re-rendering your app

Whenever a state changes, re-render the button/function
